```
Hello World!
```

I studied Computer Science at Stony Brook University (Class of 2017).
I've been working as an Software Engineer at Fidelity since June 2018.

I have interest in building things that connect together - IoT, IFTTT, etc.

Here are some of the projects I have made:

- [League of Legends Champion Cooldown](https://www.amazon.com/League-of-Legends-Champion-Cooldown/dp/B076FN3YS2/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1509574603&sr=1-1&keywords=league+of+legends+champion+cooldown&dpID=7137yMTCy7L&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)
